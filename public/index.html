      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

        Getting our data into the nested format described above requires two
        steps. First, we will create an array of objects representing each box
        we want to render. We can do this using an “uncount” style function,
        which will create as many objects as we specify based on the boxes
        variable in our dataset. For example, uncounting our first concert will
        yield 18 objects, since we have boxes: 18. After uncounting, we will
        take our big list of boxes and nest them by concert using D3’s .nest()
        method.
